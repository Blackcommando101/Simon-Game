# 🧠 Simon Game – Memory Challenge Web App

Simon Game is a classic memory-based game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The goal is to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of button presses that are randomly generated by the game. This project was a great opportunity to practice DOM manipulation, animations, and game logic using both JavaScript and jQuery.
